This plugin modifies the behavior of the Polylang plugin making it show contents of all languages, 
which are believed to be known by the visitor.

== Description ==

There are countries, where people speak several languages. For these people there is no need to
separate the content of the site by such languages, especially when they come with some unique
(i.e., not translated) content. On the other side, there can still be people, who speak only one
language.

The Language Mix plugin for WordPress is an extension to the
[Polylang](http://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin of
[Chouby](http://profiles.wordpress.org/chouby/), that implements a new approach of the multilingual
content handling. Its main feature is that it does not hide content in other languages, which are
known to the visitor! The plugin determines, which languages the user can read, using HTTP headers
sent by the user's browser, or a list of languages you want.

If a content exists in more than one language the user can read, the plugin will choose the 
best according to the user's preference, and hide the other ones, so that no duplicate contents
will be displayed.

Additionally, the plugin comes with two widgets:

* The **Languages** widget, that can be put on any WordPress page, allows to configure, content in
which languages the user wants to see. The widget saves its settings into cookies.
* The **Translations** widget, that can be put on the single content page only (e.g., the post page),
is an alternative to the Polylang's *Language Switcher* widget. The difference is that this widget
shows links only to translations of the current page (i.e., if no translations are available,
nothing is shown).

The [plugin's project](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/wordpress/language-mix) is also
hosted on the [author's website](http://www.andriylesyuk.com) *(using
[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) and WordPress)*.
[There](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/wordpress/language-mix) you can read news, report
bugs, and more.
